# Object Detection, Tracking, and Color Recognition

This project demonstrates two main computer vision tasks using OpenCV and YOLOv8.

## Description

- Object Detection and Tracking:  
  A video processing task that detects and tracks objects frame by frame using the YOLOv8 model.

- Color Recognition:  
  An image processing task that detects and labels multiple colors within an image based on their HSV ranges.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Ultralytics YOLO
